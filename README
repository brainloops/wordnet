This is a simple wrapper around wordnet to extract definitions via a RESTful api.
You'll need python installed + the following dependencies. 

cherrypy
pyaml
nltk

I created an install.sh for my particular environment (OSX 10.6.7). You can use it as an example of installing the dependencies.

You'll then need to get the actual wordnet corpus, nltk makes it easy with an included gui. Here's how.

open up a python terminal
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download()

got to corpora tab and select 'wordnet', click download
